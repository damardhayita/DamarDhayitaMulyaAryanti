Coriolanus is assigned the District 12 tribute, Lucy Gray Baird, who sparks the Capitol's attention after singing during the reaping. Coriolanus's friend Sejanus, originally from District 2, is shocked when he is paired with a tribute from District 2 and doesn't want to continue mentoring in the games.

        When Coriolanus realizes that the tributes have not been fed since arriving in the Capitol, he begins sneaking Lucy Gray food from the Academy. The other mentors follow suit, but the arrangement ends when one mentor, Arachne Crane, is murdered by her tribute after Arachne taunts them with food. Clemensia, Coriolanus's team member is distraught by the murder, leaving Coriolanus to complete an essay they were to do together by himself.

        He presents the essay to Head Gamemaker Volumnia Gaul, proposing a betting scheme and sponsorship of the tributes to engage the people of the Capitol in the Games. Dr. Gaul drops the essay into a tank of genetically modified snakes, or "muttations", then convinces Clemensia to retrieve it. The snakes are unfamiliar with Clemensia's scent, because Coriolanus had been the only one to touch the essay. They attack Clemensia, and she is severely poisoned, proving that Coriolanus was the sole author of the project.
