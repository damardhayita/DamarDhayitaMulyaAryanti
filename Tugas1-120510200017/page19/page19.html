        Suzanne Collins
            <p>
                In 2008, Collins wrote the young-adult dystopian novel The Hunger Games. Collins claims that her early exposure to Greek mythology, especially the story of Theseus and the minotaur, planted seeds in her mind for the story. It wasn't until much later, when she was flipping between war coverage and reality T.V. programming, that Katniss Everdeen's story finally came to her. Not only this, but since her father was in the Vietnam War she also took those experiences and used them as inspiration for her book. In 2009, Collins released the sequel to The Hunger Games, Catching Fire. The final book in the trilogy, Mockingjay, was released in 2010.
