                THE HUNGER GAMES<br>
                Katniss Everdeen, the story's narrator, tells the tale of a dominating Capitol and the mistreated twelve districts of Panem. Yearly, each district is forced to send a boy and a girl between the age of 12 to 18, called tributes, to fight to the death in an annual Hunger Games. Katniss' little sister, Prim, is selected for the games, but Katniss bravely takes her place and finds herself thrusted into a whirlwind of violence, confusion, and domination as she struggles to survive.

                CATCHING FIRE<br>
                The Capitol never lets the people forget that rebellion is the reason why the Hunger Games were invented, and Katniss quickly realizes that holding out those berries to save her and Peeta Mellark's life did just that. Before they embark on their Victory Tour to each district, President Snow visits the Everdeens, telling Katniss she must convince all the districts, and most of all him, that she and Peeta are truly and deeply in love, or the cost will be devastating. Although she tries hard to do so, an uprising starts in District 11 during their tour. The night of their interview, Peeta asks Katniss to marry him and she says yes, but for President Snow, it isn't enough. District 12's government is given a new head Peacekeeper to maintain political control. Furthermore, the Quarter Quell, the 75th Anniversary of the Hunger Games, pulls Katniss into the violence of the arena once more.

                MOCKINGJAY<br>
                After escaping the arena, Katniss Everdeen is taken to District 13 to take her role in the rebellion as the Mockingjay. Peeta, however, did not make it to District 13. He was kidnapped by the Capitol. They tortured him for information about the rebels, but he didn't have any, as Haymitch Abernathy told him nothing. After weeks of seeing Peeta on television, the rebels break into President Snow's mansion and free him and Annie Cresta. Katniss is relieved to see Peeta, but him not so much for her. He had been hijacked by the Capitol and believes she is not trustworthy.

            There’s quite a bit of social commentary in the trilogy, and a great deal of it is related to war; what leads to war at both individuals and societal level, and its consequences. Collins uses different characters and their arcs to show different aspects of this. -Adjoa Ocran.

            “In a way, the Hunger Games are a portrayal of reality TV,” says British School of Chicago freshman Drew Pearson. “I think it’s meant to symbolize random people being chosen for the audience’s amusement, and they can be exploited or praised for their qualities, be it physical, mental, or emotional.”
